This repository consist a SPA of Live Stock Rate for Media.net

>  Dependency :
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Jquery v3.3.1

Logic/Algo:
Initially Decided to Develop Dynamic Div so that in future if more Stock get added / Stock Replaced etc this condition should easily handle the problem
Also, all the value assign are dynamic with concatenating file name with ID's and targetting each stock directly with the best efficient manner.

The JS code is Well optimized with the least static condition specific and more dynamic condition specific.

The case could have a `display: table` but decided to go with `display: flex` to showcase some of my very few qualities.

The whole webpage is responsive throughout all devices.
